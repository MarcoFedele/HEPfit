SusyFit - a fitting tool for the Standard %Model and beyond
===========================================================

SusyFit is a flexible tool which, given the Standard %Model or any extension,
allows to:

  - fit the model parameters to a given set of experimental observables
  - obtain fit results for observables
  - obtain predictions for observables

SusyFit can be used:

  - as an executable in Monte Carlo mode, to perform a Bayesian Markov Chain
    Monte Carlo analysis of the given model
  - as an executable in single event mode, to obtain predictions of observables
    for a given point in the parameter space of the model
  - in library mode, to obtain predictions of observables for a given point
    in the parameter space of the model, allowing our computational tool to
    be used in any statistical framework

The Monte Carlo mode is based on the [BAT (Bayesian Analysis Toolkit)](https://www.mppmu.mpg.de/bat/) library.
