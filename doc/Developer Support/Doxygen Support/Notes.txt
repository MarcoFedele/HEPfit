/* NOTE TO DOCUMENTERS: 
 *
 * 1. The block @addtogroup is only necessary in one header file
 *    in any project group. This has to be the first header file when they are sorted
 *    alphabetically by their names.
 *
 * 2. Please try to stick to the conventions set in this header file. In particular 
 *    please note that:
 *      a. @brief and @detail are written in complete sentences starting with a
 *         capital letter and ending with a period
 *      b. @param[in/out] and @return are incomplete sentences not ending in a 
 *         period and starting with a small letter.
 *      c. Object and variable descriptions should be complete sentences starting
 *         with a capital letter and ending with a period. These descriptions
 *         should be inline.
 *      d. All public, protected and private members should be documented including
 *         variables and objects
 *      e. If the class member has a complicated algorithm please try to explain it
 *         clearly with the use of @li:
 *       @li Step 1
 *       @li Step 2
 *       ...
 *         etc. 
 *      f. If you make any rule that is not specified here, please add it and
 *         broadcast it.
 *
 * 3. Make sure you use linking to other classes and members liberally:
 *    http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/autolink.html
 *
 * 4. Please put in references to the literature where deserving with @cite command, 
 *    and also point out deviations from normal conventions or routines.  
 *
 *    The references have to be added to the bib file Doxygen/SusyFit.bib, where the 
 *    following manipulations have to be made: 
 *      (i) Copy a bibtex record from INSPIRE to the above bib file: e.g., 
 *           @article{Franco:2012ck,
 *              author = "Franco, Enrico and Mishima, Satoshi and Silvestrini, Luca",
 *              title  = "{The Standard Model confronts CP violation in $D^0 \to
 *                         \pi^+\pi^-$ and $D^0 \to K^+K^-$}",
 *              journal        = "JHEP",
 *              volume         = "1205",
 *              pages          = "140",
 *              doi            = "10.1007/JHEP05(2012)140",
 *              year           = "2012",
 *              eprint         = "1203.3131",
 *              archivePrefix  = "arXiv",
 *              primaryClass   = "hep-ph",
 *              SLACcitation   = "%%CITATION = ARXIV:1203.3131;%%",
 *           }
 *      (ii) Abbreviate the first (and middle) names of the authors to initials: 
 *              author = "Franco, E. and Mishima, S. and Silvestrini, L.”,
 *      (iii) Modify the title: 
 *             - Change $<math>$ to MJ[<math>]MJ,
 *             - Change a backslash to [BS],
 *             - Add “%” to avoid automatic link generation for class names, etc.,
 *             - Add escape sequence to the brackets { and } used in mathematical 
 *               symbols as \{ and \}.
 *            Namely, the title in the above example has to be modified as 
 *              title  = "{The Standard %Model confronts CP violation in MJ[D^0 [BS]to
 *                         [BS]pi^+[BS]pi^-$ and $D^0 [BS]to K^+K^-]MJ}”,
 *      (iv) Combine “year” and “eprint” in the year section: 
 *              year           = "2012 [arXiv:1203.3131]“,
 *           Otherwise, the eprint number will not appear in the bibliography page.
