LR-Basis: Initial analysis done in this basis but multimodal solutions are not always distinguishable.
PM-Basis: Final analysis done in this basis so that all modes can be separated.
SM: Contains the SM analysis including separate analysis for RD and RD*

All analysis is done both in the CLN and BGL parameterization.
All multimodal solutions are separated in the PM-Basis by predefined priors.

running the runscript file in the CLN/BGL folder creates all the necessary configuration files for the PM-Basis.
The LR-Basis config will not be updated with final numbers. It is kept only for testing purposes.
