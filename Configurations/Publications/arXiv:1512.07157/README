1. arXiv:1512.05157 contains all the files in this folder zipped together
2. Run "sh master" to create all the variations of all the configurations
3. The soft linking to the executable and the submission commands are commented out in the file called makerun
4. run_long is a sample submission file for a SGE cluster
5. A similar setup for a PBS cluster is easy to make by modifying the makerun file and creating a submission script like submit_analysis.sh. Please make sure to modify makerun accordingly. (run_long -> submit_analysis)
