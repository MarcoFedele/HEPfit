* DeltaAlpha_l[] : Leptonic contribution to alpha
   Eqs.(14-15) in J.H.Kuhn, M.Steinhauser, PLB437,425(1998) [hep-ph/9802241]
   Eqs.(5-10) in M.Steinhauser, PLB429,158(1998) [hep-ph/9803313]
   According to the latter paper, 
   oneLoop=314.19007, twoLoop=0.77617, threeLoop=0.01063 (x10^-4) 
   sum=314.97686 (x10^-4) 
   Notes: oneLoop and twoLoop are OK for me=0.00051099907, mmu=0.105658389,
          mtau=1.777, ale=1.0/137.0359895 and Mz=91.187, but only threeLoop
          differs from the above value by 5% (Why?).

   Adopting different parameters: 
     e.g. 0.0314977085 from ZFITTER vs. 0.031497714 from this class
      ===> OK!
 
 
* DeltaAlpha_t[] : top-quark contribution to alpha
   Eq.(12) in J.H.Kuhn, M.Steinhauser, PLB437,425(1998) [hep-ph/9802241]
   (-0.70+-0.05)*10^{-4} for mt=175.6+-5.5 and alpha_s(Mz)=0.118
 
    DeltaAlpha_t is slightly different from ZFITTER: 
      e.g. -6.79214e-5 from ZFITTER vs. -7.0160623e-5 from this class
           <--- no \alpha\alpha_s^2 corrections in ZFITTER?
